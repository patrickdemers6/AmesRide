# Ames Ride

When using public transportation, it is vital to know where your bus is.
In Ames, Iowa, there are two existing applications which attempt to cater to this need.
With ratings on the Play Store of 1.9 stars and 2.3 stars, the existing solutions are unreliable and unmaintained.

**Ames Ride** strives to be a reliable, modern application that informs riders of current bus locations and arrival times.

The app is available on the [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ames-ride/id1666007719), [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.demerstech.amesride), or as an APK in the [releases](https://github.com/patrickdemers6/AmesRide/releases) section.

# Features

Ames Ride has nearly all features present in alternative applications.

- View busses on a given route.
- Mark your frequent routes as favorites.
- View arrival times at a particular stop.

To ensure reliability, Ames Ride does not allow users to view multiple routes at a time.
Switching routes is a simple tap away!
